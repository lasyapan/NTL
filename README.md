# Website for NTL Hackathon Project

- Our project uses sensors to detect data like pulse rate, temperature, air quality or location coords. 
- The SIM900 GSM Module allows it to send data over a network. 
- It sends a request to the website, updates it in SQLite and redirects back to the main page.
- Every few seconds, the website refreshes and displays latest data.

This is the website part of the project, made with Flask. The ugly CSS is by yours truly.

I do however want to get rid of refreshing every n seconds and try doing something else, so I'll revist this when I've learnt javascript.
